Abstract Factory Design Pattern in Java
=====

# What is Abstract Factory Design Pattern

It is a creational pattern.

Abstract Factory patterns work around a super-factory which creates other factories. This factory is also called as factory of factories.

Abstract Factory pattern is almost similar to Factory Pattern is considered as another layer of abstraction over factory pattern. Abstract Factory patterns work around a super-factory which creates other factories.

Abstract Factory design pattern provides approach to code for interface rather than implementation.
Abstract Factory pattern is “factory of factories” and can be easily extended to accommodate more products, for example we can add another sub-class Shape and a factory ShapeFactory.

# Where to use

1) The pattern is best utilised when your system has to create multiple families of products or you want to provide a library of products without exposing the implementation details.
